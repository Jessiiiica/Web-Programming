# Web-Programming
Repository for my Web Programming coursework

My  website currently is quite general in it's purpose. It has scrolling pictures that can be changed via time, arrows or dots. It has a button that uses javascript to change it's text, css to change it's colour when pressed and has a nav bar that utilises CSS to slightly change colour when being hovered or pressed so the user knows what page they are on and when they're hovering over the button. 

It currently has three separte pages. The main page or "index" as it's refered to in the program houses the features I mentioned above. The "contact" page which has a form for users to fill. And the "Settings" page. In the settings page you can change the colours of the whole website and fill out your details. Both of these utilise local storage and stay perminently until changed again.
